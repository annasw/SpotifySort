# SpotifySort
Manually sort your spotify playlists like a jabroni

do you want to give your spotify playlist song orders the illusion of rigor?  
are you really bad at making decisions between more than two things, but weirdly good at making decisions between exactly two things?  
are you just stupid bored?

spotifysort is an implementation of quicksort intended for use with exported spotify playlists (there are services out there for this) which lets you sort said playlists based on your comparisons of pairs of songs  
it's like a fine implementation of a fast sort method, so it shouldn't take you that long.  
if i were cool i would link somewhere to the resultant playlist but um. i'm not.

spotifySort.py - obviously the thing  
am.txt - my resulting list. should be exactly the same as yours (iff you have good taste)  
spotifydecisions.txt - gto choices yw
